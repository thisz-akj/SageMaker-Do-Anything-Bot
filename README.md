# SageMaker-Make Anything Bot

## Project Overview

The **SageMaker-Make Anything Bot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance the customer experience on e-commerce websites. This solution assists customers in efficiently finding and purchasing items for various projects, whether it's a food item, industrial product, or DIY project. By addressing the challenges faced by customers in online retail environments, our chatbot provides a seamless shopping experience through personalized recommendations and real-time assistance.

## Problem Statement

Customers of large retail stores often struggle to efficiently find and purchase items needed for their projects. This leads to frustration and a poor shopping experience due to:
- Lack of a unified platform for product search, in-store navigation, and tutorials.
- Difficulty in accessing relevant recommendations and managing their shopping cart.

## Solution

To tackle these challenges, we have developed a sophisticated AI-powered chatbot that utilizes advanced technologies:
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision LLM** for understanding and processing user inputs in text and visual formats.
- **ChromaDB** for similarity search, providing accurate and relevant product recommendations.
- **Streamlit** for a user-friendly chatbot interface that integrates seamlessly with our self-created Django-based e-commerce website.

The bot offers a comprehensive solution, from finding project requirements on website to managing the shopping cart and providing solutions and tutorials for consumers to help them make whatever they want.
